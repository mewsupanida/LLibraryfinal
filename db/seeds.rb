For the design of the analog portions of mixed signal circuits, the FASTRACK simulation environment consists of a BASIC-like language called SLICE with powerful expression scanning coupled with standard language constructs such as looping, conditionals and arrays, and the ability to call simulators from within the language. With the language, Renesas has built subsystems for statistical analysis, macro-model development, and optimization. Over the years, engineers have written many routines for setting up simulation structures for a particular performance assessment and many routines for analyzing the outputs of one or multiple simulations. There are probably greater than 100 engineering-years invested in the development of SLICE and its sub-systems.",
